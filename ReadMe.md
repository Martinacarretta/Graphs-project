# Spotify project

This project contains a variety of files related to music data analysis, including GraphML files, CSV files, and a Jupyter notebook.

## Main File

The main file of this project is `Lab_AGX__202324_P1_skeleton.ipynb`. This Jupyter notebook contains the primary analysis and visualization code.

## Directory Structure

Here is a brief overview of the directory structure:

- `gephi_*.gephi`: These files are Gephi project files, which contain visualizations of the music data.
- `gephi_nodes_with_communities_*.csv`: These CSV files contain information about music communities.
- `graphmls/`: This directory contains GraphML files, which represent music data in a graph format.
- `songs.csv`: This CSV file contains information about individual songs.

## GraphML Files

The GraphML files in the `graphmls/` directory represent music data in a graph format. Each node in the graph represents a song or artist, and each edge represents a relationship between two nodes. The nodes have attributes such as `name`, `followers`, `popularity`, and `genres`.

Here are some of the GraphML files:

- gB.graphml
- gD.graphml
- gW.graphml
- hB.graphml
- pruned_G.graphml
- undirected_gB.graphml
- undirected_gD.graphml
